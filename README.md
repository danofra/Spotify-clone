# Spotify Clone with API

This project is a Spotify clone integrated with API, developed as part of my study journey. The main goal was to practice front-end technologies like Bootstrap, JavaScript, React/Vite, and Redux, while integrating data from API to provide a simulation of the Spotify platform.

## Description

The Spotify Clone with API project is a web application that emulates the interface and basic functionalities of Spotify. By using Spotify's API, it allows users to search for tracks and add them as favorites.
